# Smart-Wifi-Switch
I implemented this to my room , I can control my light and fan with my mobile. I can even set a timer for my fan.
Here, I used Esp8266 wifi module to control the relays. I used MQTT protocol with mosquitto MQTT broker to communicate. For user interface ,I used NODERED dashboard which is running on the IBM cloud.

This is the GUI of Nodered Dashboard
